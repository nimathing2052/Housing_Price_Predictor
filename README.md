# Housing_Price_Predictor

Project Goal
This initiative aims to devise a Machine Learning model that predicts real estate prices utilizing various attributes including property size, bedroom count, furnishing status, and vicinity to major thoroughfares.

Data Source Selection
Due to the preliminary phase of this project and the absence of a designated dataset, the team has opted to employ the publicly accessible Bengaluru real estate dataset from Kaggle.
